## Troubleshooting

### Latest Functional Release

 NVIM v0.10.0-dev\
 Build type: RelWithDebInfo\
 LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3\
#######################

### Keymap index of (nil) value
Encountering the "Keymap index of (nil) value" issue is often attributed to unsupported versions of Neovim. This anomaly arises when the stable release of Neovim lacks the necessary features for your particular build.
<br/>
<br/>
To address this, consider the following solution:
<br/>
1. Add the Unstable PPA:
   ```sh
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable
   sudo apt-get update

2. Install Neovim:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install neovim
